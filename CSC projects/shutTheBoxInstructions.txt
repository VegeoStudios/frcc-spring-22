This is either a 1 person or 2 person game.
At the start of the game all numbers are open, showing the numerals 1 to 9.
The object of the game is to shut all of the numbers.  The person that shuts
all the numbers on their turn wins the game.

During the game, each player plays in turn. A player begins his or her turn
by throwing or rolling dice.  
After throwing the dice, the player then "shuts" (toggles) either the number
that equals the total number of dots or the values of the two die.
For example, if the roll is 3 and 5, the player may either close the number 8,
or 3 AND 5.  If a number is already shut then it will become reopened.

If a player rolls doubles:
1 player:  The player can choose to do nothing (shut then open the same number)
or toggle the box represented by the sum of the die.
For example, if you roll double 2's, you can choose to toggle the 4 box.

2 player:  The player has the same options as a 1 person game, but they also get
another turn.
